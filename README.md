# hastings-qaoa-comparison

This project is inspired by Hastings' local classical thresholding algorithm presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07047 .

For the MaxCut problem, one step of this algorithm outperforms one step of QAOA on triangle-free graphs.

I am curious if this comparison can be extended to graphs with triangles, and using multiple steps of the algorithm.
Is the thresholding algorithm still advantageous?
